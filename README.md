# Project 4 Inspiration :man_scientist: :stethoscope: :pill: 
The TV show “House” served as inspiration for our group’s data science project, HEALTHhOUSE. We plan to combine our knowledge of Flask web application development, machine learning, algorithms and data visualizations to create a model that predicts diseases based on a pattern of symptoms. The plan for our predictive model is to assist users in identifying potential illnesses more efficiently, mirroring Dr. House and his medical team’s diagnostic prowess. 

# Analysis :memo: :green_apple:
Data is everywhere. The amount of data points at our disposal for consideration and analysis is expansive, immeasurable, and uniquely complex. Technology has proven to be a powerful tool assisting clinicians in determining a patient’s probability of acquiring specific health conditions and diseases. The likelihood that one will experience either an illness, sickness, or other medical condition is inevitable. With this in mind, our group selected healthcare as our topic of interest to explore the ways predictive analytics could be used to accurately determine which disease a person would likely have given the symptoms they selected in the algorithm. Data science influences advancements, and innovations, and creates meaningful changes based on reliable outcomes leading to a better quality of life. As progress in machine learning algorithms continues and new technologies emerge, concurrently, we can also ensure improvements in efficacy, validity, and accuracy. Predictive modeling working in tandem with personalized medicine has its advantages such as empowering healthcare practitioners to deliver targeted treatment and interventions that will ultimately enhance patient healthcare outcomes and satisfaction. Using tools like HEALTHhOUSE's Disease Discovery Tool would be a wise investment to quickly check the pulse of your health. After all, your health is your wealth!
