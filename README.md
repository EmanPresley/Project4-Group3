The TV show “House” served as the primary source of inspiration for our group’s data science project, HEALTHhOUSE, a machine learning model that predicts most likely diseases based on a pattern of symptoms. The plan for our predictive model is to assist users in identifying potential illnesses more efficiently, mirroring Dr. House and his medical teams' diagnostic prowess.

# Project 4 Overview :lab_coat: :stethoscope: :pill: 
We Collaborated as a group to implement all the major components and competencies of Data Science. On the data engineering side, we began by choosing a topic that would depend on our understanding of developing machine learning models. We decided on Healthcare since we could incorporate the TV series "House" into our slide deck and presentational narrative. Next, we searched through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for datasets discussing symptoms, diseases, and demographics. Given the limited number of open datasets that included our list of criteria in one file, we were challenged with locating and comparing multiple datasets discussing the same diseases and symptoms. We found two datasets matching the criteria to meet our project goals. [Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning?resource=download) and [Disease Prediction through Symptoms] https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usamag123/disease-prediction-through-symptoms/code) Finally, we preprocessed and cleaned our datasets, queried the data, built a full-stack web application, linked our machine learning model, Tableau Visualizations, an About Us page, and created an engaging and informative slide deck presentation [HEALTHhOUSE Slide Deck Presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGAo4miO1A/pu0g0g1_Bt2ud6xsoSsdug/view?utm_content=DAGAo4miO1A&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)

# Analysis :bar_chart: :green_apple: :fountain_pen:
Data is everywhere. The amount of data points at our disposal for consideration and analysis is expansive, immeasurable, and uniquely complex. Technology has proven to be a powerful tool assisting clinicians in determining a patient’s probability of acquiring specific health conditions and diseases. The likelihood that one will experience either an illness, sickness, or other medical condition is inevitable. With this in mind, our group selected healthcare as our topic of interest to explore how predictive analytics could be used to accurately determine which disease a person would likely have, given the symptoms they selected in the algorithm. Data science influences advancements and innovations, creating meaningful changes based on reliable outcomes that improve life quality. As progress in machine learning algorithms continues and new technologies emerge concurrently, we can also ensure efficacy, validity, and accuracy improvements. Predictive modeling working in tandem with personalized medicine has advantages, such as empowering healthcare practitioners to deliver targeted treatment and interventions that will enhance patient healthcare outcomes and satisfaction. Using tools like HEALTHhOUSE's Disease Discovery Tool would be a wise investment, offering quick and easy health checks from the comfort of your home. After all, your health is your wealth!
